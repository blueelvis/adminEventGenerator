# adminEventGenerator

###Note: A Compiled executable is readily available for download in the source code. False positives with Antivirus might come because of the nature of AutoIT.

``Right now, there is no way to get the Administrative Events of the Event Log in Windows Operating System through the command line and save them in the EVTX file format.``

That event log is useful in troubleshooting various scenarios and it helps the troubleshooter since he/she doesn't have to scroll through a lot of events. Only the important events are logged in the Administrative Event.

This application is written in AutoIT language. More about AutoIT over here - https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/


Right now the application is at the prototype stage. There is nothing fancy. But, I plan on adding several features so that it becomes easier for the troubleshooters to use the application.


Enjoy!
